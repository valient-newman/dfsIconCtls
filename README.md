  dfsIconComboBox and TdfsIconListBox v1.17
  
  A caching Icon ComboBox and ListBox component for Delphi.
  
  A dropdown list style combobox that displays the icons that exist in a given
  file, and a listbox that displays the icons that exist in a given file,
  either horizontally or vertically.
  
  Features:
    Optionally, the control can disable itself when the filename is invalid.
    Optionally, the control can load icons "on demand."  This speeds up the
      initialization process greatly because all icons do not have to be loaded
      when the control is created.
    Many file formats can be read from, including:
      .EXE, .DLL, .ICO
      .ICL { PCTools? Icon Library
      .NIL { Norton Icon Library
    ListBox can simulate a grid of icons, allowing you to set the number of
      icons to be displayed in both the X and Y direction.  This setting can be
      changed dynamically.
